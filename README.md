## About

I build high-performance web applications with a focus on clean architecture, scalability, and reliable real-time behavior.

Currently working on **Flowboard (n8n)** — scaling an open-source workflow automation engine using event-driven systems.

**Primary interests**
- Real-time systems & WebSockets  
- Event-driven architecture (Kafka)  
- High-performance caching (Redis)  
- Backend-heavy full-stack development  

Open to MERN / Next.js collaborations and remote roles.
